The Title field should be in title case, current version then in title case:

Comments about notes:
1. I believe that NEWS.md has recently been allowed on CRAN
2. The URL is valid (I'm not sure why it keeps saying 404, I don't understand how to make R think it's ok, but the URL is fine)
3. I don't think ggplot2 should be in title case

Thanks

You need to put single quotes around ggplot2 in the title and   
description, and write ggMarginal()

Fixed from previous submission: added single quotes around 'ggplot' and added brackets after 'ggMarginal()`.  
Still getting the "Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:" NOTE for shiny apps, I'm not sure how to fix my shiny server configuration. I will try to look into that in the future. Reply from previous submission comment: yes, it is my own site

## Submission comments:

Tested on Windows and 7 and Ubuntu 12.04. There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs and 2 NOTEs.

Note 1 is about possibly invalid URLs. This is because I have a URL of a Shiny app, and Shiny Server doesn't currently support returning http headers. Note 2 said I should capitalize `ggplot2` to `Ggplot2`.

Fixed previous NOTE by adding 'methods' package to
  DESCRIPTION. (Note was:
* checking dependencies in R
  code ... WARNING
'::' or ':::' import not declared
  from: ‘methods’)

Previous submission also had
  a comment about the "possible invalid URLs", which I
  addressed in my first submission: The URLs are valid
  URLs that point to Shiny apps on a Shiny Server.
  Shiny Server doesn't currently support returning http
  headers, hence the curl command fails. But the URLs
  are fine.  Shiny Server is working on fixing that.
